          "I am 22 years old and I love art and design at an early age, so I've
          dedicated my life to it.
          <br />I graduated from Bikaner Technical University with Bachelor of
          Technology in Mechnical Engineering. I'm always open to collaborating
          on exciting new projects and connecting with like-minded individuals.
          Feel free to reach out and let's discuss how we can create something
          amazing together. Let's shape the future of the web, one line of code
          at a time."
